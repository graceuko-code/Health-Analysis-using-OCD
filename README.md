# OCD HEALTH ANALYSIS

### Project Overview

This is to find out some facts about people living with OCD disease. This analysis aims to provide detailed insights into the prevalence, trends, and characteristics of OCD across different demographic groups. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle. It is a fictional dataset, so facts from this dataset shouldnâ€™t be used for real-life assumptions.

### Background

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a chronic mental health condition characterized by persistent, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions) that an individual feels compelled to perform. These obsessions and compulsions can significantly interfere with daily life and activities.
